# owczarczak.zsh-theme
My personal OMZ theme. A definite WiP  

This theme is heavily based on Bira and Dieter with a hint of Fino-Time

I have however modified it to include right alighnment on the first line as I wanted to push the git and conda propmt info to the side.

My next tweaks may include addjustments for smaller tmux panes. Depends on how annoyed I get with it as is.
